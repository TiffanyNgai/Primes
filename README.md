# Primes
SYDE 121 - A#2 Q1

Assignment instruction:
A prime number is an integer greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself. A palindromic prime number is a prime number
whose value remains the same even if reversed (e.g., 11). Reference URL: http://oeis.org/A002385

1. Write a program that will allow the user to enter an integer that is greater than 1. The user will keep entering values
   until the required number is provided.
   The program then computes and outputs all the prime numbers that are less than or equal to the entered value.
   For all primes less than 10,000, if the number is also a palindromic prime, then indicate that as part of the output. You may not hardcode palindromic prime
   values.
   For all primes less than 100,000, if the sum of digits is odd, then indicate that as part of the output.
   Before writing any code, outline program steps as comments. After that, appropriately declare and initialize a number of variables for this problem, and give
   each identifier a descriptive name. Avoid magic numbers. Introduce functions where appropriate.

2. Verify that your program is correct by manually computing the result (e.g., on paper, using an online calculator), and then compare that result with the output
   of your program; test a number of different values.
   As a comment at the start of your program (i.e., using /* ... */ notation), explain what values you used to test the program logic, and identify the valid range
   of values for which your program will work correctly and efficiently.
   Note that for very large input values, your program may take long time to compute prime values, which may not be reasonable to the user. Do not insert all your
   code into the main() function.
